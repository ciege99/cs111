# cs111
My projects from CS 111: Operating Systems Principles @ UCLA W20\
Grade received: A+\
Some projects have had extraneous files removed (such as photos and screenshots), so some Makefile dist targets expect files that are not present.\
Lab 1: Building a multiple-process telnet-like client and server.\
Lab 2: Building a thread-safe global counter & linked list with mutex locks, spin locks, and atomic functions and analyzing each of their performances.\
Lab 3: Explore the Ext2 file system in Part A and construct a report on the layout of the system, while in Part B the reports are analyzed for inconsistencies using Python.\
Lab 4: Build a temperature gauging program to be used on an embedded system (Beaglebone), as well as reporting this information to a server using TLS and TCP protocol in Part C (Part A of the lab is omitted as it only deals with setting up the Beaglebone).
