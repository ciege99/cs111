PROJECT 3B - File System Consistency Analysis
---------------------------------------------

FILES
-----

* lab3b.py -
Python source file for the lab3b program to analyze a file system summary csv
file and report on all discovered inconsistencies. Takes in the csv file as the
primary, required argument. The program first reads in the csv row by row, and
appends each row to a python list corresponding to the row type. The superblock
and group data is read and metadata such as the minimum and maximum block and
inode numbers are extracted.

Then inconsistencies are detected in the following manner:
- check all block pointers to be within the minimum and maximum block number
- check the reference counts for every block (eg. for unreferenced, duplicate,
  or freelist blocks that are allocated)
- check inodes are allocated or on freelist
- check number of links to an inode are consistent
- check directory entries are allocated or on freelist
- check directory links for . and .. entries

* Makefile -
lab3b : make the lab3b program
dist  : make the tarball
clean : remove lab3b link and tarball
