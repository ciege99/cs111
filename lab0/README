Files:

* lab0.c
lab0.c contains my implementation of the program. 
I first begin by parsing through the options using getopt then for each option
that is parsed, a switch statement is used to either implement file redirection
(in the case of --input and --output) or set a flag for a segfault or catch later
(since the segfault should not happen until after file redirection has taken place).
The input and output switch cases also check for errors in opening files, and 
call to functions to print an error message and exit if there is an error.

After all options are parsed, if the flags for --segfault or --catch have been
raised, these are set off, with --segfault setting a null pointer to have 
the value '0' and --catch signalling to another function to print
an error message and exit with code 3.

Finally, there is a while loop that repeatedly reads in a byte from
the input file descriptor and then writes it to the output file descriptor
until the EOF has been reached. After this section, the program then exits with
code 0. 


* Makefile
Makefile contains my implementation of all of the different args that can be 
used with Automake.


* backtrace.png and breakpoint.png
These images show my use of GDB as described in the spec. 


* check_tests (Smoke tests)
check_tests contains my smoke tests. This is a shell script that runs my 
executable with varying options and input and checks that it exits with the
correct code each time. 
Include tests are:
    Run with no options, return 0
    Run with --input, return 0
    Run with --output, return 0
    Run with --input and --output, return 0
    Run with --fake, return 1
    Run with incorrect usage of option, return 1
    Run with --input without permissions for input file, return 2
    Run with --input with non-existent file, return 2
    Run with --output without permissions for output file, return 3
    Run with --segfault and --catch, return 4
    Run with all options, return 4
