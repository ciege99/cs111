* lab4c_tcp.c
This programs take all of the functionality of lab4b, but takes out the button
shutdown option and adds in the required parameters described by the spec
and reads in/prints out to the tcp server. 

It begins by parsing the options and non-switch options and storing them in
their respective variables. Then it initializes the temp sensor. Next, it calls
the setup_tcp function, which handles the tcp protocol. This function calls
the socket system call on our socket file descriptor. It then gets the host
by using the host name and the gethostbyname system call and converts it
to an ipv4 address. This then is added to a sockaddr_in struct which is used
with the connect system call to connect to the server. The function then
closes stdin and stdout and dups the socket file descriptor to override 
the input/output of the program. Finally, the function sends the ID of the 
program to the server. 

After this the main function begins the reporting of the temperature and
command parsing, polling the socket and writing to the logfile and handling
commands as new input is detected. It then exits successfully when OFF is 
called.

* lab4c_tls.c
This program has the same structure as the tcp version besides the tls 
functionality. This is handled with the setup_tls() function, which
begins by initializing SSL with the SSL_library_init() function and
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(). We then call TLSv1_client_method() to create 
a method and then we create a context with SSL_CTX_new(method) function. We
then call setup_tcp to set up the tcp socket (same functionality as
lab4c_tcp.c). SSL_set_fd is then called to link the socket and ssl, and then
we connect with SSL_connect(ssl). Finally we send the ID with SSL_write
and replace other uses of writes to stdout with SSL_write's to ssl and 
replace reading from stdin with reads from SSL_read instead. 

* Makefile
build: makes lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls programs
lab4c_tcp: target for lab4c_tcp.c
lab4c_tls: target for lab4c_tls.c
dist: makes tarball
clean: removes tarball and lab4c_tcp/tls executables
